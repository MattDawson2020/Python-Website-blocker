## 🐍 Python-Website blocker

- Bonus project from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Uses a simple Python script with the native time and datetime modules to block websites during working hours


## 📓 Comments

- Quite simple to make if you know how Windows hosting/ redirects work. Checks time of day and runs a loop that either adds or removes websites from the redirected site list depending on the time of day
- Idea to time a loop to check every five seconds is quite clever because it can turn a very CPU intensive script into something very mild that can be run in the background constantly


## 💻 Running the app

- Clone this repo to your local machine
- Open a terminal/shell/bash using administrator, it will not work otherwise
- In this window navigate to the repo and use ``` python website_blocker.py ```
